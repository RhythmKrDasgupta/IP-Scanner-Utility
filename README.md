A scalable IP reputation and threat intelligence utility designed for security teams and researchers.

This tool aggregates data from multiple intelligence providers to assess malicious activity, abuse history, anonymity usage (VPN/Proxy/Tor), and contextual network metadata. Built with performance and automation in mind, it supports asynchronous execution, structured output, and bulk scanning for real-world security operations.


It automates the process of evaluating IP addresses by querying multiple reputation and intelligence sources, consolidating results into a single, actionable view. The tool is optimized for bulk scanning, asynchronous execution, and operational reliability, making it suitable for incident response, threat hunting, and security automation workflows.

Key objectives of the project include reducing manual investigation time, improving detection accuracy, and enabling scalable security analysis through automation.
